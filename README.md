# Mind Space

Mind-space is a simple, one page website which aims to provide users with some basic information regarding mental health. The site maintains a calm theme and provides users with a peaceful space to learn. Mind-space also provides links to other resources and organisations which can be used to learn more or access help. Finally, Mind-space provides a short section with positive quotes from famous and influential figures. 

## Planning
### Colour Palette
![Colour Palette](assets/images/color-palette.png)

The colour palette was generated by Claude.ai with direction of creating a calming colour scheme which would be appropriate for a website about mental health while maintaing good contrast values for the text on the body of the page.

### Wire Framing
![Wire Framing](assets/images/Wire-framing.png)

Because I was planning to build with bootstrap, I did my initial wireframing only for mobile. When I came to creating the website I had a clear idea of how bootstrap would work for mobile and then I only had to write the rules which would allow the mobile format to expand to a larger screen.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Hero section__

  - The hero section of the website provides an introduction for the user. When first viewed they are presented with a calming photograph, the website name and an invitation to learn more.

- __Navigation bar__

  - The nav bar sits below the hero section and provides the user with links to all the different portions of the page. Upon scrolling past the Nav bar it will stick to the top of the screen so that the user can reorientate themselves no matter where they are on the page.
  - On the Nav bar there is also a link which opens a modal where the users can contact the website creator and leave feedback.

- __Information Cards__

  - Created using bootstrap, the information cards will provide a broad overview of mental health topics and issues.
  - The cards will be brief in content and encourage the reader to learn more on each topic by using the links below.

- __Resource Links__

  - The four resource links will allow the reader to gain a more indepth understanding of the topics covered if they wish and will link them to an external page.

- __Quotes__ 

  - The quotes section will be a carousel where the user can scroll through various positive quotes from famous people.

- __Footer__

  - The footer will hold a condensed version of the nav bar with the additional option of a contact us modal. There will also be a copyright section.

### Further Features

- __Contact Modal__

  - The contact modal would be accesible from the bottom nav bar. A pop-up window would allow the user to fill in a form with their name, email address and a message. 

## Testing 

The majority of the testing process was conducted while the website was still being produced. Using a local test server and the developer tools built into the browser I was able to effectively test the responsiveness of a range of devices. Various visual issues were also identified during this process. I ran some code through AI models like Claude and ChatGPT in order to identify typing errors or missed divs which I could not see myself.

Early deployment on Github Pages was essential to see how the website would be viewed by a user and helped me to highlight further issues such as broken file pathways.



### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Using landscape display on mobile devices causes the subheading in the hero section to clash with the nav bar and information section.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
